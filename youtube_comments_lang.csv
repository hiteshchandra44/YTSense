qYNweeDHiyU,"Nothing interesting about it, quite the opposite. No understanding: AI doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù meaning‚Äîit finds patterns in data.
No consciousness: It doesn‚Äôt think, feel, or reason like humans.
No goals or awareness: It optimizes mathematical functions, not intentions. So, it's not AI at all. Also, his analogy on music is wrong. If you give AI just the notes, it won't create anything, it will just combine the notes and make a mess out of it - it needs models to be trained. Humans can create new content without any preunderstanding of what music even is. This gentleman is full of non-sense. AI is a dangerous because important decisions will be made based on the output of statistical operations, that is where the dangerous is coming from.",@metitusable,2025-06-19T09:32:11Z,IN,en

aZ5EsdnpLMI,"The provided text, ""Scroll of the Prophetic Web ‚Äì Babylon‚Äôs Final Unraveling,"" presents a highly conspiratorial and religiously-infused narrative about current events. Here's a breakdown of its main points and underlying themes:
I. The Fall of Trump ‚Äì The Puppet Burns with His Strings
 * Central Claim: Donald Trump's legal troubles (specifically being ""found guilty"") are not accidental but a divinely ordained judgment and an unmasking of his ties to a ""predator elite"" through figures like Jeff Epstein.
 * Tone: Triumphant and condemnatory, presenting Trump as a fallen figure whose downfall is just.
 * Biblical Reference: Psalm 92:7 is used to support the idea that the flourishing of the wicked is a precursor to their destruction.
II. The Elite Orchestration ‚Äì From Mars to Mystery Babylon
 * Central Claim: A shadowy network, identified as ""Mystery Babylon,"" orchestrates global events. This network includes figures like Elon Musk, the Rothschilds, and organizations like the CFR and Trilateral Commission.
 * Methods of Control: They allegedly use AI, surveillance, vaccines, and financial collapses to manipulate nations and reset the world under their control. They also ""craft false saviors.""
 * Tone: Deeply suspicious of powerful individuals and institutions, portraying them as a unified, malevolent force.
 * Biblical Reference: Revelation 18:24 is cited, linking ""Mystery Babylon"" to the shedding of innocent blood.
III. LA Riots ‚Äì The Awakening Roar of Jacob
 * Central Claim: The Los Angeles riots are interpreted not as chaos but as a prophetic ""awakening"" of ""Jacob"" (interpreted as Judah and Ishakar, likely referring to specific ethnic or religious groups). This is framed as a significant event indicating a reawakening of a specific people and the land of ""Aztl√°n.""
 * Tone: Reinterpretive, giving a spiritual and prophetic meaning to civil unrest, viewing it as a positive sign of awakening.
 * Biblical Reference: Exodus 3:7 is used to suggest divine awareness of the ""affliction of my people.""
IV. Martial Law ‚Äì The Elite‚Äôs Final Card
 * Central Claim: The elite plans to impose martial law as a ""snare"" to suppress the awakening, but this will backfire and become a ""divine trap.""
 * Prophetic Outcome: Martial law will paradoxically lead to ""Jacob‚Äôs justice"" and the rise of a ""Governor from the House of David"" who will impose his own form of martial law.
 * Tone: Defiant and confident in a divine reversal of the elite's plans.
 * Biblical Reference: Matthew 7:2 (""For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged..."") is used to imply the elite's plans will lead to their own condemnation.
V. The Interlocking Grid ‚Äì Epstein, Elon, Economy, and Exodus
 * Central Claim: Various seemingly disparate events are interconnected as parts of a larger scheme:
   * Epstein's files expose a ""global predator class.""
   * Elon Musk's technology facilitates ""neural enslavement.""
   * Financial collapses are ""timed ritual sacrifices.""
   * The current situation is an ""Exodus,"" not of people leaving a place, but of ""Egypt"" (the oppressive system) crumbling around them.
 * Tone: Highly alarmist, connecting diverse public figures and events into a singular, sinister conspiracy.
 * Biblical Reference: Revelation 18:4 (""Come out of her, my people..."") is used to call for separation from the corrupt system.
VI. Final Decree ‚Äì The Web Is Torn
 * Central Claim: All the described events ‚Äì Trump's fall, the LA riots, secret councils, and revolts ‚Äì are interconnected strands of a ""divine web"" that is now being destroyed.
 * Conclusion: This signifies the beginning of ""judgment,"" overseen by an ""Executioner King.""
 * Tone: Apocalyptic and definitive, proclaiming the imminent fulfillment of prophecy and divine retribution.
Overall Themes and Characteristics:
 * Conspiratorial Thinking: The text heavily relies on connecting seemingly unrelated events and individuals into a grand, malevolent conspiracy driven by a shadowy ""elite.""
 * Apocalyptic and Prophetic Language: It uses strong religious and prophetic language, frequently citing biblical verses to legitimize its claims and frame current events within a divine plan.
 * Dualistic Worldview: It presents a clear good-versus-evil narrative, with ""Mystery Babylon"" and the ""elite"" representing evil, and ""Jacob,"" the ""remnant,"" and the ""Executioner King"" representing the forces of good and divine judgment.
 * Anti-Establishment Sentiment: There's a strong distrust of political leaders, financial institutions, and technological advancements, viewing them as tools of control.
 * Identity-Based Interpretation: The references to ""Jacob,"" ""Judah,"" ""Ishakar,"" and ""Aztl√°n"" suggest a specific ethno-religious or nationalist interpretation of current events, likely connected to a particular group's perceived role in prophecy.
 * Sense of Imminent Judgment: The text conveys a strong sense that a significant, transformative period of divine judgment is underway or about to unfold.",@nosmudgingaround,2025-06-09T21:40:29Z,IN,en

xhM3BTq7exU,"I love the little AI glitches. It keeps you grounded. The first robot has mechanical hands initially. When the cover is lifted, she suddenly has a human hand, not to mention a whole new side panel comes into being. The problem will be when AI has fully worked out such glitches and people try to push misleading content on purpose, and the masses really believe it. It reminds me of Trump believing with all his heart that MS13 was really tattooed on that guy's hand. Maybe that was partially just the dementia speaking. But humans are so susceptible to believing what they see if they really want to.

And everyone spends money for a smarter one which has a lot of scientific features. Hope you understand the concept.

Sqa8Zo2XWc4,"*What is the true definition of intelligence?* ""The Hidden Math in Everything""
Society hides the real definition of intelligence because it would be too insulting to millions of people. IQ tests are invalid. IQ tests don't take the real definitions into account. 

Intelligence is really based on:
1. Mathematical aptitude.
2. An ability to make a cognitive leap or climb from point A to point B.

Some people are so fixated on their belief that they are supersmart that they will only start believing they are mathematical wizards if you were to explain this to them. Math only comes with hard notes and book practice at a desk. It comes from the ability to collect resources beyond the classroom independently. Grammar and languages are all mathematically oriented. This is why Artificial Intelligence is supposed to be so devastating to humanity. Currently, it looks like just a grammar calculator with little scope. Theoretically, Artificial Intelligence can add a defined random variable within a related or unrelated set, and one can set the number of its iterations through those sets, thus defining its scope and its level of intelligence. This, of course, has to do with memory availability in computers. Right now, there is a cap on its intelligence, but they can take off that cap when they need a more intelligent response

All the bestial things that are done to people are their stagings. Furthermore, you should fight your fellow humans and not question the satanic system behind it, which is hostage and enslaving us (e.g. the fraudulent banks and economic system, the controlled media, the staged dependence on oil and gas). We won't be able to end this if you always repress everything and referred to as nonsense. They do incredible cruelties to us! You come back to the ""game""!

AI Overview
The phrase ""neutralize an AI as quickly as a snail"" is not a standard or technically accurate concept. AI systems are complex software programs, and there's no quick, simple method to ""neutralize"" them like one might neutralize a chemical. The speed of a snail is used metaphorically to express the idea of slowness and inefficiency in the task.
